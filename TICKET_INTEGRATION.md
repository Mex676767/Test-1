# C9 Tickets integration

The LiveChat widget creates tickets and reads their latest status through the
C9 Tickets REST API. The API key remains in the Cloudflare Pages environment;
the browser calls only this project's `/ticket-*` functions.

Configure these environment variables on the deployed Pages project:

- `TICKETS_API_KEY` — a developer-issued `tmk_...` key owned by a user whose
  role can view and create the relevant tickets.
- `TICKETS_TO_DEPARTMENT_ID` — the numeric ID of the department that receives
  tickets raised from this widget.
- `TICKETS_MARKET_ID` — optional numeric market ID applied to new tickets.
- `TICKETS_API_BASE_URL` — optional; defaults to
  `https://tickets.96ghq.com/api/v1`.

After saving the variables, redeploy the Pages project. The widget reads the
live ticket field catalog, so changes to select options appear without a code
change.

The ticket API currently supports list, read, and create. It has no update or
attachment-upload endpoint, so the widget links agents to the ticket system for
those actions.
